# CubeSatIMU
Cubesat ISAE-Supaero student project

This repository provides the codes, parts and reports used to design a custom PCB carrying an IMU (Inertial Motion Unit), an Arduino Nano and an SD card module.

The goal of this project is to accurately measure orientation aboard student-made experimental rockets, where the PCB is carried as payload.

It flew for the first time abord SCALAR VI, a two-stage experimental rocket made by students from the Supaéro Space Section in 2025.

Detailed information can be found in the reports.
